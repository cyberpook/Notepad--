# Notepad--
Notepad-- - simple programm to create and edit text files.
Notepad-- - successor of well-know Notepad on Windows(but better a lot xD)

You can use Notepad-- to edit, open and save txt files. 
You can also use Notepad-- for printing, but we strongly do not recommend to use it for printing. At the current time, the printing is at the stage of development.
With Notepad-- you can change font, font scale, find all needed words in the text, or, otherwise, manipulate txt files as you wish.

List of available shortcuts, which will simplify your work:
      F5 /* puts Date and Time into the text */
      Ctrl + + /* Zooms up */
      Ctrl + - /* Zooms down */
      Ctrl + 0 /* Restores default scale */
      Ctrl + N /* Calls File->New */
      Ctrl + Shift + N /* Calls File->New Window */
      Ctrl + O /* Calls File->Open */
      Ctrl + S /* Saves current changes */
      Ctrl + Shift + S /* Calls File->Save as */
      Ctrl + P /* Calls File->Print */ (not recommended)
      
In future we will probably fix bugs with printing, but at the current time you'd better use other utilities.
If you happened to find other bugs, you can reach us at Instagram (Help->About us) or write gmail - maxvill2016@gmail.com
